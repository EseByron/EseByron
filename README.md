👋 Hi there, I’m EseByron

I'm a multidisciplinary creative with a strong sense of responsibility and a passion for blending art and technology. I'm currently focused on leveling up my programming skills with Python and Golang, and I enjoy creating tools, experimenting with code, and exploring artistic expression through tech.

Beyond programming, I'm deeply into graphic design, video editing, and music production, which I often integrate into my personal projects. My goal is to build a life where I can share what makes me happy — and inspire others to do the same.

🔧 Currently building CLI tools and exploring real-world applications.
🎨 Always crafting something — whether it's code, sound, or visuals.
🐍 Python | 🦫 Golang | 🎛️ FL Studio | 🎥 DaVinci Resolve | 🎨 Illustrator

Let’s connect and create something cool together!
